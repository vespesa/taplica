# Taplica

An extremely simple wrapper for `tap>` that taps data into an
atom and makes it accessible from REPL. The idea is to provide
no-boilerplate tapping support without leaving Emacs and Cider.

## Usage
Taplica provides two tap functions: `tap>>` and `tap!`. Both take the
tapped value with an optional path and stores it into the Taplica
atom. The difference is that `tap>>` adds new values to the value list
but `tap!` overrides the old value with a new one.

**Note:** Although both tap functions ultimately call `tap>` (and
`add-tap` if needed), regular `tap>` calls _do not_ add data to the
Taplica atom.

Tapped values can be queried with `value` (path value list) and
`values` (whole atom contents) functions. Convenience functions
`fvalue` and `lvalue` are like `value`, but return either first or the
last value respectively.

`reset` function clears the atom and unregisters taps.

Tapping can paused with `pause` and stopped with `stop`. Whan paused
`tap>>` and `tap!` calls do nothing, but when stopped they throw an
exception. In both cases the tapping can be resumed with `resume` or `reset`.


```clj
> (require '[taplica.core :as t])
nil
> (t/tap>> "hello")
true
> (t/tap>> "world")
true
;; "hello" is path and "world" value
> (t/tap>> "hello" "world")
true
> (t/values)
{[] ["hello" "world"], ["hello"] ["world"]}
> (t/value)
["hello" "world"]
> (t/fvalue)
"hello"
> (t/lvalue)
"world"
> (t/value "hello")
["world"]
> (t/tap! "howdy")
true
> (t/tap! ["hello"] "again")
true
> (t/tap! :one :two 3)
true
> (t/tap>> [:one :two] 4)
true
> (t/values)
{[] ["howdy"], ["hello"] ["again"], [:one :two] [3 4]}
> (t/reset)
